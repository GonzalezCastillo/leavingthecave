## How to compile

Depending on the format you want, you'll have to compile one of these files:

- `ltc.tex`
- `ltc-print.tex`
- `ltc-a5.tex`
- `ltc-a5print.tex`

You will need the document class `sgcbook.cls` and the fonts it uses.
All this can be found in the repository [gonzalezcastillo/sgc-latex](https://github.com/gonzalezcastillo/sgc-latex).

## Adaptations

Since nothing can suit everybody, adaptations of this book are allowed and encouraged!
To write an adaptation, you can replace the file `main.tex` with the template  `adapt.tex` filled with the details of your adaptation and then set your creativity free.

The template is there to make things easier for you; it is just an option.
You can change the book however you want as long as you comply with the [license](LICENSE.md).

If you have any questions on these matters, send me an email. I will be very happy to help you.
